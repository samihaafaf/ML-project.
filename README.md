# ML-project.
This project does a prediction of student performance based on various attributes.


There are few steps like preprocessing, value encoding and finally implementing 4 algorithms to choose the best suitable one for the prediction.
I have done the preprocessing, value encoding and implementing KNN and LOGISTIC REGRESSION while my group mates implemented DESICION TREE AND MLP.
The details of the dataset is given in the link below.
