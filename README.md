# ML-project.
This project does a prediction of student performance based on various attributes.

The details of the dataset is given in the dataset-details file.
There are few steps like preprocessing, value encoding and finally implementing 4 algorithms to choose the best suitable one for the prediction.
I have done the preprocessing, value encoding and implementing KNN and LOGISTIC REGRESSION while my group mates implemented DESICION TREE AND MLP.
